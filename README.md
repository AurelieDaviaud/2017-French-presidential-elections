* Language: Python
* Methods: word cloud


## Context

My aim was to highlight differences between Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, the two candidates who went to the second round of the 2017 French presidential elections.

I have downloaded transcripts of the speeches that the two candidates performed from the 1st of January 2017 to the 1st of May 2017.

In total:<br>
* Macron: 31 transcripts available out of 31 speeches
* Le Pen: 25 transcrits available (transcripts: 21, subtitles: 4) out of 35 speeches.
